# AI Chatbot Learning Project

Welcome to my journey of building an AI-powered chatbot! This repository contains my hands-on exploration of creating interactive chat interfaces using OpenAI's API and Panel for the user interface.

## What's Inside

### ðŸ““ `1-hr-assistance.ipynb`
This is where the magic happens! This Jupyter notebook contains my complete chatbot implementation, featuring:

- **OpenAI Integration**: Set up and configuration for connecting to OpenAI's GPT models
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A beautiful, user-friendly chat interface built with Panel
